\title{Simulate a neutral community with a variable birthrate (VBN), saving certain precise timepoints}
\usage{
simbvarSPEC(tmax, b1, d1, k1, bneck, kneckstart, kneckend, abun_original,
  interval, wantedtimes)
}
\arguments{
\item{tmax}{Arbitrary units of time the simulation should be run}

\item{b1}{Normal birthrate}

\item{d1}{Deathrate}

\item{k1}{Carrying capacity}

\item{bneck}{Birthrate during the bottleneck}

\item{kneckstart}{Timepoint at which the bottleneck starts}

\item{kneckend}{Timepoint at which the bottleneck ends}

\item{abun_original}{A vector of initial abundances for each species such as those created by generate_spat_abund}

\item{interval}{After how many evenst should the population state be saved to the output matrix}

\item{wantedtimes}{The specific timepoints that should be included in the final matrix}
}
\value{
A matrix denoting the abundances of all the species in the community over time, with certain specific timepoints saved (wantedtimes)
}
