\title{Simple Neutral community (SN) saving certain precise timepoints}
\usage{
nulsimSPEC(tmax, b1, d1, k1, abun_original, interval, wantedtimes)
}
\arguments{
\item{tmax}{Arbitrary units of time the simulation should be run}

\item{b1}{Birthrate}

\item{d1}{Deathrate}

\item{k1}{Carrying capacity}

\item{abun_original}{A vector of initial abundances for each species such as those created by generate_spat_abund}

\item{interval}{After how many evenst should the population state be saved to the output matrix}

\item{wantedtimes}{The specific timepoints that should be included in the final matrix}
}
\value{
A matrix denoting the abundances of all the species in the community over time, with certain precise timepoints saved (wantedtimes)
}
