\title{Community Wide evolutionary Rescue simulation (CWR), with certain precise timepoints saved}
\usage{
CWRsimSPEC(tmax, b1, d1, b2, d2, m12, m21, k1, abun_original, interval,
  wantedtimes)
}
\arguments{
\item{tmax}{Arbitrary units of time the simulation should be run}

\item{b1}{Birthrate of the mutants}

\item{d1}{Deathrate of the mutants}

\item{b2}{Birthrate of the residents}

\item{d2}{Death rate of the residents}

\item{m12}{Mutation rate of mutants to residents}

\item{m21}{Mutation rate of residents to mutants}

\item{k1}{Carrying capacity}

\item{abun_original}{A vector of initial abundances for each species such as those created by generate_spat_abund}

\item{interval}{After how many evenst should the population state be saved to the output matrix}

\item{wantedtimes}{The preciese timepoints that should be saved}
}
\value{
A matrix denoting the abundances of all the species in the community over time, with certain precise timpoints saved
