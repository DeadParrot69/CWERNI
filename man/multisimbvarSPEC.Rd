\title{Simulate multiple neutral communities with a variable birthrate (VBN) saving specific timepoints and also saving the output matrix for every simulation}
\usage{
multisimbvarSPEC(tmax, b1, d1, k1, bneck, kneckstart, kneckend,
  abun_original, nsim, interval, wantedtimes)
}
\arguments{
\item{tmax}{Arbitrary units of time the simulation should be run}

\item{b1}{Normal birthrate}

\item{d1}{Deathrate}

\item{k1}{Carrying capacity}

\item{bneck}{Birthrate during the bottleneck}

\item{kneckstart}{Timepoint at which the bottleneck starts}

\item{kneckend}{Timepoint at which the bottleneck ends}

\item{abun_original}{A vector of initial abundances for each species such as those created by generate_spat_abund}

\item{nsim}{number of simulations that should be performed}

\item{interval}{After how many evenst should the population state be saved to the output matrix}

\item{wantedtimes}{Specific timepoints for which the RAC is to be plotted}
}
\value{
this function plots the RAC of the simulations for the times specified in Wantedtimes as .tiff files in the current working directory also writes a .csv file outputting the poplation matrix for every simulation performed
